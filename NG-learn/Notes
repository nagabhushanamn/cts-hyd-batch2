How angular 1.x implementing 2-way data-binding ?

  using 'watchers'/listeners  ==> functions


  how ?

  on booting , for every scoped model-property and expressions,
  angular will register 'watchers'

  watchers will read/write model when it is dirty.

  how watchers will execute ?

  using 'digest-loop' on any native-event thru $apply()/$digest()

  impt note:

   we can also register our own watchers to execute custom-logic.
